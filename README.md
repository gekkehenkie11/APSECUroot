Find out the IP of your ECU, replace mine with yours in the following URL and open the link in your browser:
http://192.168.0.16/index.php/management/upgrade_ecu

Then select the .bz2 file. After it executed the root password changed to 'newpassw', so telnet to your IP with root and 'newpassw' as password.
